# How it works

Pass your stations of interest as environment variables as in the example above and the rest is autogenerated. If you don't pass any environment variables, defaults will jump in.
It checks the MVG API for the corresponding ID of your station, then fetches the latest data and provides it via Flask.

There is no "main-entrypoint" right now like an `index.html`, all pages are autogenerated by their name / station. Same for the menu. Yes, its very simple.
